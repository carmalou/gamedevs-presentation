# Electron..? Isn't that something in an Atom?
---
class: left, middle, inverse

### Electron is a JavaScript framework that allows you to use JavaScript outside of the browser to build desktop applications.
---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Whaaaat? Is this some kind of black magic?
---
class: left, middle, inverse

### Nope, it's just a Chromium window without the url bar, back buttons and other browser navigation tools.
---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Oh, Chromium? That's the black magic, right?
---
class: left, middle, inverse

### Nope. [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) is an open source browser that pre-dates Google Chrome. Google Chrome is based on Chromium.
---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Ok, so it's basically the browser.
---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Yes and no...
---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Yes
---
class: left, middle, inverse

### When the application opens, it uses a chromium window to display the files, which allows the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
---
class: center, middle, inverse

# No
---
class: left, middle, inverse

### The files exist on the computer. They are not being served from another location.
---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Sounds kinda cool. But why would I leave the browser?
---
class: left, middle, inverse

### With Electron we can use essentially the same code to run desktop apps and websites. This opens up a world of possibilities.

# Electron apps have three basic parts

## - package.json (lists dependencies and points to main file)
## - main.js (opens and closes windows and loads html files)
## - index.html (the webpage being rendered)

# Window
---
class: left, middle, inverse

```javascript

var BrowserWindow = electron.BrowserWindow;
var mainWindow;

function createWindow () {
  // Create the browser window.
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600});

  // and load the index.html of the app.
  mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/index.html`);

  // Emitted when the window is closed.
  mainWindow.on('closed', function () {
    mainWindow = null;

---
class: left, middle, inverse

## - Handles opening and closing windows
## - Can communicate with renderer process
## - Receives messages on `ipcMain`
## - Sends messages on `webContents`

## - Controller for window
## - Each window has its own renderer process
## - Sends and receives messages on `ipcRenderer`
